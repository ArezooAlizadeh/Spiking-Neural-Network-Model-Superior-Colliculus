# A spiking neural network  model of the Superior Colliculus  that is robust to changes  in the spatial–temporal input
This repo records the the python codes for constructing a two-layer spiking neural network model with a cortical input 
layer, and a layer of superior colliculus output neurons. Each layer consists of 200 neurons, uniformly distributed on 0–5 mm of the horizontal meridian of the SC motor map. 
In the linear dynamic ensemble-coding model, the saccade kinematics are fully determined by dynamic cumulative summation of all spike vectors in the neural population during the saccade. Te input layer receives an external input signal from other inputs, which it transforms into spiking activity through its neural dynamics.
